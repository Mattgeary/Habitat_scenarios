Simulating land use changes to assess future habitat suitability for black grouse

Model takes raster maps of classified habitat and simulates land-use change from trandom start points. Aim is to create realistic iterations of potential landscape scale land use change.

New landscapes are then assessed in terms of habitat suitability for black grouse using a basic MaxEnt habitat suitability model.
